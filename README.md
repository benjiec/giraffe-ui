Javascript tool for visualizing features detected by
[giraffe](https://github.com/benjiec/giraffe).

To try it, update ```analyze.html``` and ```draw.html``` to point to your
Giraffe URL. Then run a simple HTTP server, e.g.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

and load analyze.html or draw.html from the server.
